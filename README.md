Task 6 (Routing)
Create routing for your application. 
Link app states between each other with React router.
By default user lands on a new page with empty results state (caption 0).
 
When user clicks on a film item, redirect him to: 
localhost/film/id
 
Handle invalid URLs, display create a 404 page, where user will be redirected in case of invalid URL.
On switching search type or sorting type you shouldnâ€™t switch any routes. 
When user performs a new search, you should redirect him to: 
localhost/search/Search%20Query
 
When a new user lands on the page with such URL, you should perform search and display results.
